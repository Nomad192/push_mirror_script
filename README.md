# Push mirror script
So far only .bat (for win)

## Instruction
Ð¡lone this repository to your projects folder
Run the script from the folder with your projects
1) first - Server address
2) second - Your git username
3) third - Your git password

example: `up-to-date.bat` `m3133.ddns.net` `USERNAME` `PASSWORD`


example: (without a new window and with pause) 
```
cmd /c call up-to-date.bat m3133.ddns.net USERNAME PASSWORD
pause
```

## Attention
Keep in mind that the script also sends local branches to the second server, which were deleted in the repository, but remained with you locally!

This script will also try to send itself to your account: 
1) you can store the turnip of this script also in your account
2) or just ignore the error of sending to your account

## Info
Maybe there will be a .py script in the future
